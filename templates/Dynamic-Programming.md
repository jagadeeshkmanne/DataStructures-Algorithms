## 📋 **All DP Patterns**

| Pattern | Identification Tips |
|---------|-------------------|
| **[Decision Making](./dp/decision-making.md)** | Take/skip choices with adjacent constraints |
| **[Knapsack](./dp/knapsack.md)** | Limited capacity + items with cost/value |
| **[Grid Path](./dp/grid-path.md)** | 2D movement with path optimization |
| **[String DP](./dp/string-dp.md)** | Two strings character comparison |
| **[Tree DP](./dp/tree-dp.md)** | Tree structure with node choices |
| **[Graph DP](./dp/graph-dp.md)** | DAG traversal with optimization |
| **[Interval DP](./dp/interval-dp.md)** | Optimal range splitting |
| **[LIS Pattern](./dp/lis-pattern.md)** | Longest increasing sequence |

## 🔍 **Pattern Recognition Process**

### **Step 1: Is it DP? (10 seconds)**
```
✓ Optimization present? (maximize/minimize/count ways)
✓ Choices at each step?
✓ Overlapping subproblems?
→ If YES → It's DP!
```

### **Step 2: Count Variables (10 seconds)**
```
One variable changes (i, amount, index) → 1D DP
Two variables change (i,j) → 2D DP
```

### **Step 3: Identify Pattern (10 seconds)**
```
What am I deciding at each step?
- Include/exclude with constraint → Decision Making
- Items with capacity limit → Knapsack  
- Movement in grid → Grid Path
- Compare two sequences → String DP
- Tree structure choices → Tree DP
- Graph traversal optimization → Graph DP
- Split ranges optimally → Interval DP
- Maintain increasing order → LIS
```
